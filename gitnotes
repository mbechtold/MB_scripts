# If you have changes in the downstream master you want to keep, 
# I would do the following to keep the downstream master the same but create a new branch on the upstream master.
git checkout -b upstream-master
git fetch upstream
git reset --hard upstream/master
git push --set-upstream origin upstream-master

# amend last commit
git commit --amend --no-edit
# if last commit already pushed
git push -f origin some_branch   

# cherry-pick
